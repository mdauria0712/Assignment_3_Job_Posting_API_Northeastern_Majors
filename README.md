# Assignment_3_Job_Posting_API_Northeastern_Majors
For my project, I encorporated API that tracks job postings with the available college majors at Northeastern University. This incorporates the economic benefits of specific college majors and the availability at one of the best universities in the Northeast. 

When applying to colleges, I feel that many high school applicants go about the process incorrectly, thinking about, "what would I love to study", instead of, "what industry would I like to work in", "which jobs can I get after college", and "how much can I get paid", these are many variables that help evaluate the quality of the degree you are getting, which doesn't go into the thought process of many high schoolers. I used Adzuna, which provides information about job postings, combining this with deepseeks information about finding relevant jobs with a specific degree, I was able to find relevant job data. And with Northeastern specifically finds if the major is available at that specific university.

Run the main.py file, follow the prompts, and it will provide information for a college major of your choosing.
