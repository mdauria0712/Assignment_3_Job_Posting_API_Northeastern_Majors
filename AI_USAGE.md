For this project, I mostly used AI to create the Northeastern Web Scraper. I found it again extremely difficult to find a website that allowed web scraping, so I asked Claude which
colleges allow web scraping for their academic programs website and it showed be northeastern, which worked. Furthermore, I relied on it to create the web scraper, and much of the
code was made by Claude

Lastly, another instance I used AI was implementing deepseek into the project, I was previously unfamilar with this, but GPT taught me how I can correctly incorporate it.
